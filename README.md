# Browser Flags

our website requires the browser to be started with a flag to run correctly:

**NOTE: ALL CHROME INSTANCES MUST BE CLOSED BEFOREHAND**


- navigate to `chrome.exe` (example: `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application`)

- open command line  in this location (in file explorer, right click -> Open in Terminal)

- run the following command: `.\chrome --allow-file-access-from-files` 

- this will open a new chrome window with the flag set. without closing this window, open the `index.html` file
